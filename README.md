# personal-website

Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Terminal
- GitHub pages
- JS live server 

## Approach Taken:
The approach I took when building this website was first to make an outline of where I wanted things to go usings Divs(navigational bar, images, content,etc.).After this I began to make the navigational bar and wrote a for loop with conditionals to get this to switch to different pages while hiding a different page. I added my headshot and then started to add links to my site that would give access to my github, linkedin, resume and a feature that turns my site into dark mode when clicked. Next on my projects page I made a carousel using a function with on click. This was you could view future projects by using the arrow buttons. After this I started to add my media queries to make my website more responsive to mobile an tablet. This was probably my most challenging part of the project because it is difficult to understand what properties to use. Lastly, I added my content as well as my color scheme. 


## Link to Site

## Installation Instructions
clone my repo and set JS live server 

## Unsolved Problems
- I wasn't able to get main content container consistent on mobile and thus have to deal with the scrolling 
- Also my icons for GitHub and LinkedIn are showing up a blue color on mobile instead of the purple color I set in CSS
