                <p class="greetingText">Hi I'm Lexi, and I'm currently making my way through
                    General Assembly bootcamp. I was surprised at how much I was able to learn
                    in such a short amount of time. Everyone that I've met in my class has been
                    very motivated and helpful when working on a problem be it in class or on
                    homework. I hope after graduation I am able to find a job that will challenge
                    me and give me fun problems to work on.

            <div class="aboutContent content">
                <p>I decided to go into accounting because I love numbers and found that making things balance cracked
                    with my brain. I earned my second degree in Health Administration because I found an interest in
                    healthcare, but in all honesty, I needed 150 credit hours to sit for the CPA. After an internship
                    and several accounting courses, I was hired at a public accounting firm upon graduation. I worked my
                    first busy season filled with early mornings, late nights, and weekends and realizedone busy season
                    was enough to last a lifetime. I discovered the world of coding and decided to try a few tutorials
                    to see if this would be something that would suit me, and it did. I began researching bootcamps and
                    accidentally applied to general assembly and got so wrapped up in coding while making mini websites
                    for the application that I knew this was something I'd love. The difference I feel doing bootcamp
                    for 60 hours a week versus accounting is huge because somehow I still have energy to want to learn
                    and code more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I owe my love for traveling and exploring to my mom because she is a flight
                    attendant and has taken me around the world since I was young. The place that I
                    found most exciting on our adventures is New Zealand because I was lucky enough
                    to visit Hobbiton aka The Shire. I have recently found true crime podcasts which
                    has been a rollercoaster of an adventure, but don't judge a book by its cover.
                    These cases are sad yet interesting. I recently got my first pet Lola, and she
                    has quickly become my best friend. On top of all the other hobbies, making fresh pasta
                    has made me fall in love with cooking and baking more than I could've ever imagined.
